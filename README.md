# Neepneep DAC


This is the version that plays audio from a flash chip.

## V1
My original prototype, working with the Attiny85 and the winbond W25Q32 flash chip.


## V2

V2 is currently a work in progress, i'm trying bring the cost down so i'm trying to switch over to a smaller flash and move over to a different chip so this one will not program the Attiny85

I'm looking at the Attiny412 and the 8mbit version of the flash chip.
